- **Using MinGW causes crashes.** I strong recommend you **do not use MinGW** to compile at this time.

"Quick" How-To

For complete instructions on how to build the Godot 2.x version of GodotSteam from scratch, [please refer to our documentation's 'How-To Modules' section.](https://godotsteam.com/howto/modules/) It will have the most up-to-date information.

Alternatively, you can just [download the pre-compiled versions in our Releases section](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam/releases) and skip compiling it yourself!

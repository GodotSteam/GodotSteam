Compatibility
---
While rare, sometimes Steamworks SDK updates will break compatilibity with older GodotSteam versions. Any compatability breaks are noted below. Newer API files (dll, so, dylib) _should_ still work for older versions.

Steamworks SDK Version | GodotSteam Version
---|---
1.59 or newer | 4.6 or newer
1.58a or older | 4.5.4 or older

Versions of GodotSteam that have compatibility breaks introduced.

GodotSteam Version | Broken Compatibility
---|---
4.8 | Networking identity system removed, replaced with Steam IDs
4.9 | sendMessages returns an Array

Known Issues
---
- Steam overlay will not work when running your game from the editor if you are using Forward+ as the renderer.  It does work with Compatibility though.  Your exported project will work perfectly fine in the Steam client, however.
- **Using MinGW causes crashes.** I strongly recommend you **do not use MinGW** to compile at this time.

"Quick" How-To
---
For complete instructions on how to build the Godot 4.x version of GodotSteam scratch, [please refer to our documentation's 'How-To Modules' section.](https://godotsteam.com/howto/modules/) It will have the most up-to-date information.

Alternatively, you can just [download the pre-compiled versions in our Releases section](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam/releases) and skip compiling it yourself!

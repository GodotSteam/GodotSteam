Known Issues

- **Using MinGW causes crashes.** I strong recommend you **do not use MinGW** to compile at this time.

"Quick" How-To

For complete instructions on how to build the Godot 2.x version of GodotSteam from scratch, [please refer to our documentation's 'How-To Modules' section.](https://godotsteam.com/howto/modules/) It will have the most up-to-date information.

Compatibility
---
While rare, sometimes Steamworks SDK updates will break compatilibity with older GodotSteam versions. Any compatability breaks are noted below. Newer API files (dll, so, dylib) _should_ still work for older versions.

Steamworks SDK Version | GodotSteam Version
---|---
1.59 or newer | 3.23 or newer
1.53 to 1.58a | 3.12 to 3.22.4
1.52 or older | 3.11.1 or older

Versions of GodotSteam that have compatibility breaks introduced.

GodotSteam Version | Broken Compatibility
---|---
3.25 | Networking identity system removed, replaced with Steam IDs

Known Issues
---
- **Using MinGW causes crashes.** I strongly recommend you **do not use MinGW** to compile at this time.
